Bubble Sort:

Advantages:

Simple Implementation: Bubble sort is straightforward to understand and implement.
No Additional Space: Operates in-place, requiring only a constant amount of extra memory.
Disadvantages:

Inefficiency: Poor time complexity, especially inefficient for large datasets compared to quicksort and mergesort.
O(n^2) Time Complexity: Worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), which is impractical for large datasets.
Scenarios for Use:

Suitable for small datasets or situations prioritizing simplicity over efficiency.
Effective for nearly sorted arrays due to its adaptive nature.
Quicksort:

Advantages:

Efficiency: Excellent average-case time complexity of O(n log n) and performs well on large datasets.
In-Place Sorting: Can be implemented to sort the array in-place, requiring only a logarithmic amount of additional memory.
Adaptive: Adapts well to nearly sorted arrays and performs efficiently in practice.
Disadvantages:

Not Stable: Not a stable sorting algorithm; it may change the relative order of equal elements.
Worst-Case Time Complexity: While average-case time complexity is good, the worst-case time complexity can be O(n^2), though rare with good pivot selection strategies.
Scenarios for Use:

Ideal for large datasets or situations requiring high performance.
Commonly used in practice due to efficiency in various scenarios.
Mergesort:

Advantages:

Stable: Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.
Predictable Performance: Consistent time complexity of O(n log n) regardless of input data, suitable for scenarios requiring predictable performance.
Parallelizable: Easily parallelized, efficient for multi-core or distributed systems.
Disadvantages:

Additional Space: Requires extra memory proportional to the input array's size, less suitable for memory-constrained environments.
Scenarios for Use:

Well-suited for scenarios requiring stable sorting and consistent performance.
Often used in external sorting applications, such as sorting large files not fitting into memory.
