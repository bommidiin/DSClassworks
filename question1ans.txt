Linked List in Bookstore System:

Adding a Book:

Context: When a new book is added to the bookstore inventory.
Utilization: A linked list is employed to dynamically add a new book. Each book, represented as a node (e.g., struct BookNode), is added to the end of the list. The next pointer ensures the linkage, and the linked list allows for easy addition without the need to predefine the number of books.
Listing Books:

Context: When the user wants to view the list of available books.
Utilization: Linked lists are effective for sequential traversal. The program starts from the head of the list and iterates through each node, printing book details. This suits scenarios where maintaining the order of books matters or when sequential access is common.


Binary Search Tree (BST) in Phonebook System:

Adding a Phone Record:

Context: When a new phone record is added to the phonebook system.
Utilization: A binary search tree is utilized to efficiently store phone records. Each node in the BST represents a phone record, with insertion maintaining a sorted order. This allows for quick and organized addition of phone records, with the tree structure facilitating efficient searches.
Searching for a Phone Record:

Context: When the user wants to find a specific phone record by providing a name.
Utilization: BSTs excel in searching operations. The program traverses the tree in a binary search fashion, efficiently locating the desired phone record by comparing names. This ensures quick access to records, which is crucial in a phonebook system.
Listing Phone Records (In-order Traversal):

Context: When the user wants to view all phone records in a sorted order.
Utilization: The in-order traversal of the BST produces a sorted list. This is utilized to display all phone records in an organized manner. The program visits each node in ascending order, printing the details of each phone record, offering a sorted view to the user.
In both scenarios, the linked list is advantageous for dynamic additions without the need to specify the size beforehand, making it suitable for scenarios where the number of items can vary. The binary search tree, on the other hand, is ideal when maintaining a sorted order and efficient search operations are priorities, as in the context of a phonebook system.
