/*Each Step of the bubble sort process for the array [12, 6, 4, 9, 2]:
1. Easy: Understanding Bubble Sort

Certainly! Let's perform a dry run for the Bubble Sort algorithm on a different array: [12, 6, 4, 9, 2].

Original Array: [12, 6, 4, 9, 2]

Pass 1:

Compare 12 and 6: Swap (result: [6, 12, 4, 9, 2])
Compare 12 and 4: Swap (result: [6, 4, 12, 9, 2])
Compare 12 and 9: Swap (result: [6, 4, 9, 12, 2])
Compare 12 and 2: Swap (result: [6, 4, 9, 2, 12])
After Pass 1: [6, 4, 9, 2, 12]

Pass 2:

Compare 6 and 4: Swap (result: [4, 6, 9, 2, 12])
Compare 6 and 9: No swap
Compare 9 and 2: Swap (result: [4, 6, 2, 9, 12])
After Pass 2: [4, 6, 2, 9, 12]

Pass 3:

Compare 4 and 6: No swap
Compare 6 and 2: Swap (result: [4, 2, 6, 9, 12])
After Pass 3: [4, 2, 6, 9, 12]

Pass 4:

Compare 4 and 2: Swap (result: [2, 4, 6, 9, 12])
After Pass 4: [2, 4, 6, 9, 12]

Final Sorted Array: [2, 4, 6, 9, 12]

The array is sorted using the Bubble Sort algorithm after these passes.
