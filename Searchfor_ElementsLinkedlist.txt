Commence at the Beginning: Initiate the search process by placing a pointer at the beginning of the linked list. This pointer will guide the exploration through the list.

Traverse Through Nodes: Employ a loop to progress sequentially through the linked list, checking each node, until either the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached.

Evaluate Each Node's Value: At every node, compare the stored value with the target element in question.

Continue Until Discovery or End: If a match is found, the search is successful, and the process can halt. If not, move on to the next node and repeat the comparison.

Handle End of List: If the end of the list is reached without locating the target element, it indicates the absence of the element in the list.

Communicate Outcome: Based on the search result, return either the node containing the target element (if located) or a message indicating the element is not present in the list.

Conclude the Search: Terminate the search algorithm upon finding the target element or reaching the end of the list.

This step-by-step approach carefully examines each node in the linked list until discovering the target element or completing the traversal, making it a reliable and efficient technique for searching in linked lists.
